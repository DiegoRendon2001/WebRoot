        <p>Greetings everyone, my name is Diego Rendon. A little about me is that I love to web design. I love video games. My top 3 are Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Destiny 1, Overwatch 1. The last interest that I have is buiding PCs. So far I think I have built about 5-6 computers, all of which were for gaming of course!</p>

                    <p>This was a web application that was made by me and 4 other classmates and I took part of the design work.</p>
                    <p>BNB-B is a simplified bed and breakfast app developed by myself and four classmates. We worked together using what we learned in class to design and create a bed and breakfast app.</p>
