        One of the main things that I learned about this experience was that I think of changing majors. Nothing wrong with this class or anyone, I just think this isn't really the right career path for me. On a brighter note, I think I was able to do a great job designing some of my cool projects and I hope that it can be of use to me in the future. Being with a team sure does help out a lot and I think I had a great team. We all did what was instructed, and we all helped each other out.

        What all this means to me is that I should be thankful of hard working teammates and that I should soon move on from this journey of web/software development.

        Like I mentioned, I think this career path isn't for me. Something that I am interested in and have been working on for a little bit is digital marketing. What I think I could use from this is the knowledge I gained in this course about websites, I will be able to use to my advantage for my next journey. As part of my community, there's places here and there that I could use my knowledge to help branch out and help smaller businesses, or clubs.

        Definitley designing was my best strength that I learned I could do. Thanks to Google and YouTube, I learned a decent amount of knowledge using CSS and how to make transitions and other cool configurations.

        Probably the most humbling moments in my times were not being able to do some of the homework, just because it is a lot of information, and I think I was just behind most of the time. I thought I was a decent programmer, for at least the amount of experience I had. I thought wrong, I'm not caught up with everyone and I learned to live with it.</p>

          Some pointers I would give to the next generation is to make sure you're caught up, from the very beginning, make sure to understand the foundation and for this career type, you're going to have to put a lot of effort trying to understand what's going on. In the end, it's a great field, especially the pay. But it's not as easy as it seems.
