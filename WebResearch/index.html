        <p>
            In this section, you will be learning the significance in HTML and the basic understanding.
            Under this text you will find a link which could take you into another webpage that explains the importance of HTML. 
            What you learn here is "What is HTML", which basically is a coding language which is the most popular for building websites. 
            Here you learn about HTML like tags, attributes, and types of code editors. This is very important for a web development class
            because without any of this, we wouldn't be able to build a lot. We'd be missing out on so much and the usability for HTML is 
            absurd. Follow the link below to further investigate the basic understanding of HTML.

        <div class="BasicCSS">
            <h1><b>Importance of CSS</b></h1>
            <p>
                In this article you will learn the very basics of CSS and how important it is. Usually, developersâ€™ kind of leave the CSS out of their heads
                since they assume it's the easiest part. Though it may be somewhat correct, I find that hard to believe since CSS is what makes your website
                different from others. Think about it, without the creativity and CSS, all the websites will look so boring and almost all the same. Especially
                learning in web development classes, CSS should not be left out since there is a reason a lot of front-end developers use this language. I would 
                recommend learning more about CSS and this article has links to which you can learn all sorts of things like the history of CSS, colors, units used, 
                box models, padding and so much more. Down below is the link which will take you to learn more about CSS.

        <div class="BasicWebDev">
            <h1><b>Importance of Web Development</b></h1>
            <p>
                With this link I learned the importance of web development. For example, I learned that a good definition of web development is 
                A web application, often referred to as a web app, is an interactive computer program built with web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), 
                which stores (Database, Files) and manipulates data (CRUD), and is used by a team or single user to perform tasks over the internet.

                Another thing worth mentioning was that this shows you a step-by-step guide on how to build a website. This article also teaches you the different types of web applications like 
                Mailchimp which is an automation for e-mails. Google Docs, which is basically a Word, but for free and can be used online. Notion which is an AIO note-taking app that 
                a lot of small businesses use for organization.

        <div class="BasicHosting">
            <h1><b>Importance of Hosting a Website</b></h1>
            <p>
                With this article, I learned the importance of going with a credible and reliable host for your website. Some hosts that I could use are Bluehost, Veeble, and Hostinger. 
                The other thing I learned about is which way to build a website, meaning you could pick a couple of options like using site builder which tends to be a beginner level. 
                Another option could be using WordPress, which is an intermediate level of building. The last option you could use is just straight up coding, by using HTML, CSS, and JS, though 
                this will be hardest option, but the best option if you want total control.

        <div class="BasicApp">
            <h1><b>Importance of Building an Application</b></h1>
            <p>
                In this article, I learned the basics on how to build an application. The first step would be to get your ideas on paper, so you can plan how to go about this. It's best not to go 
                in the dark not really knowing how or what you want to do. The next step would be to choose what kind of application you want to build if it's going to be a Native App or a PWA. Native App
                means whether it will be suited for 1 specific mobile OS, and PWA means a Progressive Web App which will work with most hardware. The next step is to find out how you want to build the app, 
                hire someone? Code? Use an app builder? Test the app, then if everything you wanted works, you could finally publish it and post it in the AppStore, or Google Play.
