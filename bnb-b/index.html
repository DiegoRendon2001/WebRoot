    BNB:B is an alternative to a typical bed and breakfast app. It will allow users to search any area in the US for properties to rent and also allow them to submit a rental application form to the owner. Our app will have an innovative style which will make finding rental homes much easier than on other apps. We will use an API to pull data modeling homes for rent and then display that data to the customer based on their search filters. The customer will then be able to view additional details about each search result. If they like the place, and want to rent it, then they click on the apply button to contact the owner to arrange a rental date.

    <p>The contributions that I made were 99% on the deisgn part. I was the one who picked the font, colors, and did the transitions. Though it doesn't seem anything crazy, it did take me a while and I wanted to make sure the designs were perfect, to which the group never had an issue on.</p>

    <p>My experience was that working in a team is pretty fun and is necessary to become mature enough to know your responsibilites and make sure you can tackle them as best you can. Communication is also key! I am not sure if we have any plans to move even further with this project, but I would also be open to it.</p>

    <p>Some pointers I would definitley give is to always ask questions. Communicate with the group, and finally to make sure you're willing to put the effort, this class isn't the easiet and you have to put a lot of hours outside of class to gain more experience. Making self projects are definitley the easiest way to get better at coding.</p>
