      <p>Hello everyone, my name is Diego Rendon. I am a student at Bellevue College and I am working towards my Bachelors degree for ISIT: Application Development. I made this webpage so that you, my audience, can feel inspired to make a change in the 1 place we call home, which is our beautiful and magnificent planet named Earth. I hope by the end of this journey that I made for you, you will understand why it's going to take more than just 1 human to make a change for this world.</p>
