    <h1>3 main problems that we're facing:</h1>

    <div id="leftbox">
      <h2>The Arctic:</h2>
      The temperatures in the Arctic continue to increase at 3 times the global annual average, driving many of the changes underway in the Arctic. Most importantly, snow and ice are melting at an dramatic rate. This impacts both local ecosystems and the global climate system. It contributes to rising sea levels, and is most likely to provoke extreme temperature changes far beyond the Arctic. The effects of a shifting Arctic climate are felt across the global environmental, economic, and social implications.

      <h2>The Waste:</h2>
      The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a report in 2021 on the environmental impacts of food waste. EPA estimated that each year, the U.S. food loss and waste totals to 170 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent GHG emissionsequal to the annual CO2 emissions of 42 coal-fired power plants. This estimate does not include the significant methane emissions from food waste in landfills. EPA data shows that food waste is the single most common material landfilled and incinerated in the U.S., comprising 24% and 22% of landfilled and combusted municipal solid waste. The report also shows the benefits of preventing food loss and waste in terms of agricultural land, blue water, fertilizer, and energy.

      <h2>The Energy:</h2>
      The IPCC has found that emissions from fossil fuels are a huge cause of global warming. In 2018, 89% of global CO2 emissions came from fossil fuels and industry. Coal is the dirtiest type of energy and is responsible for over 0.3C of the 1C increase in global average temperatures. This makes it the largest source of global temperature rise. Oil releases a huge amount of carbon when burned, about a third of the worlds total carbon emissions. There have also been many oil spills lately that have seriously impacted our oceans ecosystem. Natural gas is often promoted as a cleaner energy source than coal and oil. However, natural gas is still a fossil fuel and accounts for a fifth of the worlds total carbon emissions.
