    <p>Like mentioned in the previous page, we're experiencing a huge change within our Earth. One of the easiest solutions for the average person to help out would be turning off your lights if they're not in use. It would use less energy while saving you money. Another way you could help is limiting your shower length. According to the United Nations Foundation, limiting your shower to 5 minutes for 1 year could save as much carbon emissions as is sequestered annually by half an acre of U.S. forest. It would also reduce your own water use by about 45 gallons per week. Though I know that limiting your shower time can be a hard. I know some people can take up to 20 minutes, but if they were to just adjust it to 12-15 minutes, that's still an easy way a person can help for free.

     <p>Other ways to help out if you're up to the challenge is purchasing solar panels. Some facts about solar panels according to a blog named MoxieSolar, solar power is the most abundant energy source on Earth. It's also cheap, since 2008, the cost of solar panels has dropped by 80%. Worried about having low sunshine? Even if the Sun is not directly beaming on the panels, like if there was a cloudy day, it doesn't mean the hues reflected from sky are't being utilized. The last and most important fact, in 30 years, the average rooftop solar panel system can reduce pollution but ~100 tons of carbon dioxide.
